I have experimented with lots of changes with different branches.

**here is the result:**
1. if you create a branch it only **contains the same files and folders of its parent.**
2. If you create another branch from the same parents that **will be a different child** which also only contains the files and folders from the parents too.
3. now if you make any changes to one of the children **it only changes that child with that parent files**.
4. but **you can merge both of the children with the parent as long as they (the children) have no conflict** with each other.
5. but **you can easily merge with one child easily there will have no issue** with that.
    

> so this is how everything is works

6. so now if you have another child from one of the children it can be also merged as long as it has no conflict with the parents. but remember it's just merging means **other changes have been also included with your final merge.**
